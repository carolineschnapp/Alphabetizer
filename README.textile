h1. What's this for

This is a jQuery plugin that sorts the children of an element aphabetically. The sort is not case-sensitive.

Usage:

bc. jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  jQuery('#my-list').alphabetize();
});

The above will sort all the children of #my-list alphabetically.

You can sort the children of many elements at once:

bc. jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  jQuery('.alpha-sort').alphabetize();
});

The sorted elements are returned.
