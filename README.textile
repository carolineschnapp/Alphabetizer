h1. What's this for

Sort the children of an element aphabetically. The sort is not case-sensitive.

Usage:

bc. jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  jQuery('#my-list').alpha();
});

The above will sort all the children of #my-list alphabetically.

You can sort the children of many elements at once:

bc. jQuery(document).ready(function() {
  jQuery('.alpha-sort').alpha();
});

What is returned is the sorted element.
